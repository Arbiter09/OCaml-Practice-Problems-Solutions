### Introduction

OCaml is a powerful functional programming language with features such as type inference, pattern matching, and an advanced type system that make it a great tool for both academic and industrial applications. This repository aims to:

- Offer practice problems for beginners and intermediate learners.
- Provide fully worked-out solutions for reference.
- Demonstrate various OCaml language features and idiomatic usage.

Whether you are a student, hobbyist, or professional developer, these exercises will help you explore OCaml and enhance your functional programming skills.

### Getting Started

### Install OCaml

You can install OCaml using your system’s package manager, [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/), or by downloading the compiler directly from the [OCaml website](https://ocaml.org/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arbiter09/OCaml-Practice-Problems-Solutions.git
cd OCaml-Practice-Problems-Solutions
```
````

### Running the Solutions

- Launch the OCaml REPL with `ocaml` or use:
  ```bash
  ocaml filename.ml
  ```
- In many cases, you can also compile solutions to a native or bytecode executable:
  ```bash
  ocamlc filename.ml -o filename
  ./filename
  ```

### Modifying/Extending Solutions

Feel free to modify any solution or write your own approach. You can create additional `.ml` files to experiment with alternative methods or more optimized implementations.
